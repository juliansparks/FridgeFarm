We envision our project being used by anyone that has a refrigerator, so they may keep track and update their inventory without needing to actually check their refrigerator.. This includes not only home users but also office managers in small business and food & beverage managers in small restaurants. To spite the economic advantages of using inventory management (less waste, more timely shopping list creation, use statistics), Automatic inventory management systems can be prohibitively expensive for small businesses and home users. We hope to bring the advantages that automatic inventory management systems provide to a wider market by implementing a subset of their features at a significantly lower cost. We plan to achieve this by using low cost hardware, namely Raspberry Piâ€™s and inexpensive bar code readers.
